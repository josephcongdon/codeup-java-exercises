    //comparing to String types is .equals();
    // .equalsIgnoreCase
    // break java up into multiple methods
    //Method overloading -- create methods with the same name that take different parameters

    //JAVAII

    //OOP-- how to break apart classes in an object-oriented way
    //Four pillars of OOP (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)
    // Visibility (public/protected/private) Encapsulation -- defining the gate-keepers creating the getter and setters
    //Instantiation - making objects
    //Static vs. Instance???
    // INSTANCE NEEDS THE "new" keyword
    // EXAMPLE Person tom = new Person();
    // tom.walkAround();
    // Instance methods /variables rewire an object be made to use them

    // static does not require the creation of an object

    //ARRAYS

    // way of keeping track of a group values that are the same type

    // WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ARRAY AND ARRAY LIST
    // Arrays are fixed in length
    // Arrays can hold primitive values(int)
    // Arrays can be faster than ArrayList.
    // ArrayList can hold the reference typeof a value

    // INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM
    // method overriding- replace the default version of the inherited method
    //super keyword

    //INTERFACES AND ABSTRACT CLASSES
    // when you have to share common state behavior across subtypes, use an abstract class.
    //when you have to share common behavior use an interface

    //Collections
    //  Framework for various classes and interfaces to extending / implementing your own collection types.

    // Some collection implementations, we focused on ArrayList and HashMap

    //Annotations
    //Things with @

    //Exceptions and Error Handling
    //  Unchecked vs. Checked Exceptions
    // How to handle exceptions
    //1. try/catch
    //2. throws

//    How to read and write  to text files
    // create files and Directories
